TODO:

- use HTML5

- don't become too complex

- how to handle index.html if existing?

- internationalization? (based on multiviews? - check if enabled?)

- directory index

  - sorting by different data (date/time, size, file type, alphabetically, ...)
  - maybe different views like in Kodi
  - maybe showing indexes only for images, videos, ...?
  - album directory image for sub-directories?

- GPS data

  - show map with points for all picture locations - show data/picture on point?
  - show GPS data as map when viewing a picture

- image views

  - use links to create image of specified size
  - slideshow?
  - implement zooming feature instead of choosing an image size
  - show image data

- Caches (configurable time limit up to eternal)

- use Memoize


Not yet sure:

- Allow comments?
- Integrate with social media
-
