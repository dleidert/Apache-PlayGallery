TODO:

- next: add different sorting options

- implement view parameter, that works like this: ?view=w100, h200,
  w100-h200, h200-w100 and without something useful, show picture;
  the sub must create the picture in question and use a cache!

- idea: add a parameter page=1,2,... to split directory views into
  pieces. Add a parameter to define number of pictures to show.

- idea: use a function to retrieve data for an image via template
  -> either provide a special parameter, or nothing (then use key list
     provided by option) and return hash. Use EXIF values as keys
  this function can be memoized!!!!
  - use another function to retrieve the localized parameter name?
  - this function should be called from template files

- use HTML5

- don't become too complex

- how to handle index.html if existing?

- internationalization? (based on multiviews? - check if enabled?)

- directory index

  - sorting by different data (date/time, size, file type, alphabetically, ...)
  - maybe different views like in Kodi
  - maybe showing indexes only for images, videos, ...?
  - album directory image for sub-directories?

- GPS data

  - show map with points for all picture locations - show data/picture on point?
  - show GPS data as map when viewing a picture

- image views

  - use links to create image of specified size (use cleanup phase to create
    those images?)
  - slideshow?
  - implement zooming feature instead of choosing an image size
  - show image data

- Caches (configurable time limit up to eternal)

- use Memoize


Not yet sure:

- Allow comments?
- Integrate with social media
